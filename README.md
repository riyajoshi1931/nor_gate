  ### Abstract
  NOR GATE is a universal Logic gate. It can be used to build all other gates, also the complex circuits with higher number of transistor. A logic gate is physical design       that implements Boolean function. They are the building block of the high performance circuits. Its implementation is done using Synopsis Custom Design Tool. Here I am       using CMOS Technology because temperature stability, stronger anti-noise ability and lower power consumption.
  
  ### Circuit Details
  For the design of any circuit with the CMOS technology; We need parallel or series connections of nMOS and pMOS with a nMOS source tied directly or indirectly to ground and   a pMOS source tied directly or indirectly to Vdd.
